Giaoculator Lite: A Better [Giaoculator](https://github.com/Haoxuan1016/Giaoculator).

## Why Giaoculator **Lite**?

Giaoculator will not longer be itself. We need to know what is Giaoculator:

**Gialculator is...**

>*A chrome extension*

>*A GPA Calculator*

>*A schoolis++* 

>*GPA planning extension*

**Giaoculator is NOT...**

>*A big green button*

>*GPA booster*

>*An automatically pop-ups genreator*

>*left ideal of a ring*

>*An advertisement pop-ups book toaster\**

### Less is More

The philosophy of this version of Giaoculator focuses on "less." In modern society, our ability to produce something is much easier, causing everyone to pursue their wants, many of which are unnecessary. It is too easy for us to add a brand new function to this project. However, these new features, like those wants, are not aesthetically commendable. In fact, they will only create confusion in functionality.

### Occam's razor
Giaoculator is a GPA calculator, and it should only be a GPA calculator; the extra functions added to Giaoculator are unharmonious. Designers create the use of a program, and their main goal is to ensure that every user can understand how it can be used. To achieve this, everything should be simplified.
>plurality should not be posited without necessity.
